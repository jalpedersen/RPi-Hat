Raspberry Pi B+ Hat
============================

Expansion Board
----------------------------

This is a project template for a 
[Raspberry Pi B+ Hat](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats).

This is based on work of [xesscorp](https://github.com/xesscorp/RPi_Hat_Template)

This version includes a CAT22C32 EEPROM for ID EEPROM as well as DS1340 RTC for
keeping track of time.
 

All headers (except ID_SC and ID_SD) are brought out into a separate header for
easy access. Also two small prototyping areas are provided
